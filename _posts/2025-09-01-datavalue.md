Managing data is complex and challenging. Often the technical diffulties distact our focus from the real goal of data - driving value for the business. Too often we encounter data teams who are working flat out to deliver data, but with unsatified stakeholders. 

One of the key tools we use in Kelvin Analytics are data value propositions. A data value proposition is a clear and concise statement that communicates how this data will bring value to the business. 

We work alongside the business to help them articulate these propositions in a way that data teams can understand. These propositions provide a guiding star for data teams who are swamped with complexity and competing demands. Your business stakeholders won't care about your data pipelines but they do care about their pricing model.
