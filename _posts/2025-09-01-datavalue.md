Your business stakeholders don't care about your data pipelines. They just want to succeed. Data value propositions ensure that the hard work of data teams actually drives success. 

Managing data is complex and challenging. As data teams, the technical challenges can often distact our focus from the real goal of data - driving value for the business. Too often we encounter data teams who are working flat out to deliver data, but with unsatified stakeholders. This is usually the result of an ever increasing burden of deliverables with no obvious way to prioritise between them.

One of the key tools we use in Kelvin Analytics are **data value propositions**. A data value proposition is a clear and concise statement that communicates how this data will bring value to the business. 

To generate a set of data value propositions, we run a sequence of structured workshops with business teams to understand what decisions they need to make and how data could inform these decisions. We help the users of the data to articulate the value of data in a way that data teams can understand. For example:
> By segmenting customers based on their likelihood of making repeat purchases, we can target our marketing more effectively.

These propositions provide a guiding star for data teams who are swamped with complexity and competing demands. 

Once we have a clear picture of how the data would be used, we can refine and prioritise these data value propositions according to effort, impact, and other considerations to inform a delivery roadmap that is ambitious for customers while also allowing incremental delivery.
