There has been a lot written about data products in recent years. 

To my mind, this shift of focus to data products are a response to the fact that very few businesses feel they are being well served by their data. Data becomes a costly and time consuming effort that is rarely at the heart of how the business makes decisions.

Adopting a data product mindset aims to shift the focus to what will be most valuable to users. Making decisions about how best to manage, clean, curate, and serve data becomes simplified when the users are treated as the highest priority. 

[Right data at the right time, and in the right format](https://www.databricks.com/blog/building-high-quality-and-trusted-data-products-databricks).

A common pitfall when building data products is to skip the step of identifying a data product owner. This person should sit between the business and the data teams, guiding priorities according to what will add most value for users. Finding the right person to engage with the business is hard, and so there is a temptation for the data teams to name a data product and then send it out into the world without clear ownership. 

This is a mistake. 

The result of this omission will be that data teams make well-intentioned but poorly informed decisions about the data, while the business becomes increasingly removed from the data.
