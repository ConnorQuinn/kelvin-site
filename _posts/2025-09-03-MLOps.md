Every company aims to be data-driven. But in reality, many machine learning projects get stuck in development and never help to support the business. Failure to deliver ML projects to product leads to wasted investment, frustrated teams, and missed opportunities to deliver real business value.

## What is MLOps — and Why It Matters

MLOps is all about **taking the principles of DevOps and applying them to machine learning**. It covers the whole lifecycle:

- Tracking experiments and models
- Automating training and deployment
- Monitoring performance and drift
- Managing governance, security, and compliance

Without MLOps, ML projects often stall. Different teams build their own workflows, model versions get lost, and no one knows which model is actually running in production. Worse still, compliance and governance gaps can leave companies exposed to risk.

With MLOps, your ML pipelines become **repeatable, reliable, and auditable**. You can trust your models, your teams can collaborate, and your business can actually capture value from AI.

- **Unified Lakehouse Platform** – One place for raw data, clean data, and ML-ready features. No more juggling multiple platforms.
- **MLflow integration** – Experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment are built right in. No bolted-on extras.
- **Unity Catalog governance** – Centralised security, lineage, and compliance across all your data and models.

## How to Get Started

Getting started with MLOps on Databricks doesn’t need to be overwhelming. Here’s a simple roadmap:

1. **Review your current workflows**  
   Where do models currently live? How are they deployed? What breaks most often?

2. **Identify the gaps**  
   Look at reproducibility, governance, monitoring, and cost. Where are the risks?

3. **Leverage the platform**  
   Use Databricks features like AutoML, MLflow, Delta Live Tables, and Unity Catalog to close those gaps.
