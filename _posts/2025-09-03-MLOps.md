# Why Your Company Needs MLOps on Databricks: Faster, Safer, Smarter AI

Every company talks about *‚Äúbeing data-driven‚Äù* these days. But in reality, many machine learning projects get stuck in the lab. Models work fine in a notebook but never make it into production. The result? Wasted investment, frustrated teams, and missed opportunities to deliver real business value.

This is where **MLOps** comes in. And when you combine it with **Databricks**, you get a powerful foundation for scaling machine learning across your organisation.

## What is MLOps ‚Äî and Why It Matters

MLOps (short for *Machine Learning Operations*) is all about **taking the principles of DevOps and applying them to machine learning**. It covers the whole lifecycle:

- Tracking experiments and models
- Automating training and deployment
- Monitoring performance and drift
- Managing governance, security, and compliance

Without MLOps, ML projects often stall. Different teams build their own workflows, model versions get lost, and no one knows which model is actually running in production. Worse still, compliance and governance gaps can leave companies exposed to risk.

With MLOps, your ML pipelines become **repeatable, reliable, and auditable**. You can trust your models, your teams can collaborate, and your business can actually capture value from AI.
